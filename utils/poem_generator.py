        prompt += f"""The poem should be {min_lines}-{max_lines} lines long with the following expert-level characteristics:

1. Linguistic Craftsmanship: Use powerful, evocative language with precisely chosen words that create rich sensory experiences. Each word should be deliberately selected for its sound, connotation, and emotional resonance.

2. Advanced Figurative Language: Create sophisticated metaphors, similes, and symbolism that transform concrete elements from the image into profound poetic expressions. Develop these figures throughout the poem for deeper meaning.

3. Masterful Technique: Employ advanced poetic techniques such as:
   - Controlled rhythm and meter appropriate to the poem type
   - Deliberate sound patterns (alliteration, assonance, consonance)
   - Strategic line breaks and stanza structures
   - Effective repetition and variation
   - Subtle rhyme schemes (if appropriate to the style)

4. Emotional Depth: Create multiple layers of emotion and meaning that resonate with universal human experiences while remaining authentic to the specific image.

5. Cultural Resonance: Subtly incorporate elements that connect to rich poetic traditions around the world. Draw from the techniques of master poets who have written brilliant examples of this type of poetry.

Do not include a title or any explanatory text, just the exquisite poem itself. The poem should feel as though it was written by one of the world's greatest poets, expressing deep truths about human experience through the lens of this specific image."""
